# WGS84_DMS_Arc_Distance

Taken from the About text...

This calculator computes the arc distance of one degree, minute, and second of longitude and latitude from any given latitude (expressed in the user's choice of miles, feet, nautical miles, kilometers, or meters).  The values derived with this calculator are based on the World Geodetic Survey 1984 (WGS84) reference ellipsoid.  

The radii used in the formulas are as follows:

Semi-major (equatorial) --> 6,378,137.0000 meters
Semi-minor (polar) --------> 6,356,752.3142 meters
